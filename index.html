Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible. I have been using technology since I was very young, so I have sufficient knowledge of the Window’s and Apple’s infrastructure, however I don’t have any professional experience in IT. Technology has always mesmerized me, with the way that it has transformed our everyday life, so I decided to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology, here at RMIT.<br/><br/>

The other is my student email address s378286@student.rmit.edu.au. My interests in IT are how programs are run through an interface and how the program made has so many functions to use and how easily it is showed to the users. These interests in IT began when I used bought my laptop and used my phone a lot I realised how easy it was to use it, but didn’t really understand how it was possible to run these functions. I attended an event called a Hackathon without having any background knowledge about the event or IT. I walked in blindsided and saw the work the IT people in other groups were doing and was amazed that the codes they were typing ended up turning into a website or an app. This drove me to want to do IT. I don’t have any experience related to IT and want to learn many things throughout this course.<br/><br/>

<h3 class="major">Group Processes</h3><br/><br/>
<br/><br/>During Assignment 2, we feel as if everyone within our group worked well together. We were extremely communicative, and each member did their delegated part, whilst also stepping up to help others with their parts as well. As a group, we found that the way we worked together exceeded our expectations and we were tremendously satisfied with how well Assignment 2 went. Considering this, we haven’t changed our approach towards Assignment 3. We still all have our delegated sections to complete, and we are all expected to chip in and help other members to complete the assignment. For this assignment we have delegated tasks as:<br/><br/>
Team Profile:<br/><br/>
- Personal Information: Taken from Assignment 2<br/><br/>
- Group Processes: Solomon<br/><br/>
- Career Plans: Solomon<br/><br/>
Tools: Solomon and Wyatt<br/><br/>
Project Description: Wyatt, Sewon, Daniel, Josiah<br/><br/>
Skills and Jobs: Daffa<br/><br/>
Feedback: Everyone<br/><br/>
Group Reflection: Everyone<br/><br/>
As you can see; the tasks are spread out evenly, and as the bulk of the project is Project Description, most of the members have been delegated the task of working together to complete it. However, every member will still be expected to help with Project Description, as it is the majority of our project.<br/><br/>

<h2 class="major"></h2>
<h3 class="major">Career Plans</h3><br/><br/>
<h4>Career Plans of Assignment 2:</h4><br/><br/>
 
Daffa: Game Developer<br/><br/>
Solomon: Security Analyst<br/><br/>
Josiah: Security Manager<br/><br/>
Daniel: CTO.<br/><br/>
Sewon: Cyber Security<br/><br/>
Wyatt: Penetration Tester<br/><br/>
<h3>Career Plans of Assignment 3:</h3><br/><br/>
 
Daffa: Game Developer (same)<br/><br/>
Solomon: Security Analyst or Programmer<br/><br/>
Josiah: System Engineer<br/><br/>
Daniel: CTO (same)<br/><br/>
Sewon: Database Administrator (or  job involving SQL)<br/><br/>
Wyatt: Penetration Tester<br/><br/>
 
As you can see from the above lists, some of our member’s career plans have changed. This is due to our inspection of the Burning Glass data provided in Assignment 2, as many of us discovered that the positions we believed to be highly sought after, was not. Josiah and Sewon have both changed their career plans, whilst Solomon has begun considering a career in Programming, but is still open to a position in the field of security, and Daffa, Daniel and Wyatt’s ideal jobs have all stayed the same. Josiah’s reasoning for the change in plans is due to the position System Engineer being a more sought after position compared to that of a Security Manager, Sewon’s due to SQL being the most sought after skill, as he believes that If he possesses a vast knowledge of SQL, he should be able to secure a highly ranked position such as a Database Administrator. Solomon begun considering a career in Programming as Java is a highly sought-after skill, and he feels that he could easily secure a position within the programming field if he increases his Java skills. Daniel, Daffa and Wyatt’s have stayed the same as they consider these jobs their dream jobs, and they believe that it will stay that way. We feel that a quote by Daniel best summarizes their attitude towards their ideal positions; “There is nothing I want more than to be the CTO of a high-level company, such as Microsoft? I’m not sure yet, but Bill Gates, remember this name! I will see you soon….”.<br/><br/>
Apart from Solomon and Wyatt, who are both looking to pursue a career in Security, each member’s career plans differ from each other’s. Daffa’s ideal position is still considered the most unique of the group’s, and Daniel’s ideal job is still considered as the one with the highest prestige out of the group, with Sewon’s coming in a close second. The rest of the group’s career plans, whilst maybe not as prestigious as Sewon’s and Daniel’s, are still regarded as high-ranking positions, as well high paying. It has been clear through our talks about our future’s and career plan’s that there is one central goal that we all share: Money, and a lot of it at that, and whilst our ideal positions our goals are still significantly similar, we all wish to complete our degree and then begin to search for work, with plans to try and secure our ideal positions immediately after graduation, or if you are Daniel, begin working up the ranks towards it. None of us wish to go on to complete a Master’s, however, this can always change as we get further into our degrees. After constant chatter about our plans, we have come to the conclusion that whilst the paths to our goals may different, we still will aim to get to the same destination when arrive at the end: a high ranking position in an IT field, with a significant salary.<br/><br/>

										<h4>Solomon</h4><br/>
To be completely honest, I have never been more satisfied with a group project than I have this one. As a group, we all worked together, completing our sections and stepping up to help others to complete their parts. This was very surprising to me, as previously I have completed projects that went terribly, and I always ended up taking on the majority of the load. Working as a group can go one of two ways; really, really badly, or very, very well. I would have to say that this group project went very, very well, but perhaps next time, maybe we can manage our time more efficiently. I am extremely pleased with the outcome, and I am proud of the project we have created. I do not think the GitHub activity log successfully reflects each member’s contribution to the project, as only a few members were assigned the Tools section of the project. It is very hard for multiple people to edit a page on GitHub, so we kept the number of people on this section to a minimum.<br/><br/>

										<h4>Josiah</h4><br/>
The group worked together excellently and each person’s role was attributed quite early on so that each individual knew what their responsibility was early on and it meant there weren’t any issues in handing out tasks later on. Communication was consistent, and despite the project being done mostly in a short time frame (which could have been improved) the final product turned out to be really good. I have learnt that group work doesn’t always have to be a hassle and the final result after everyone’s work was combined came as a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>



										<h4>Daniel</h4><br/>
After the completion of assignment 2, everybody in this group has built a strong bond and has developed a high level of communication between each other. These traits were clearly displayed and shown throughout the completion process of assignment 3. Everyone was very responsive and did not complain about their allocated roles for the assignment. In addition, everyone was always willing to do more extensive work apart from their section to help finish the assignment. An area our group needs improvement is still time management as we all had other assignments to complete, leaving the project to last minute but the final result of the assignment is still of high quality. One surprising thing I learnt was creating a timeframe is very difficult and time consuming but it is an important aspect of a project, to ensure everything is on track. One thing I learnt from my group is communication and teamwork is key in a group and these two attributes combined can create impressive work.<br/><br/>




										<h4>Wyatt</h4><br/>
From Assignment 2, we learned that tasks delegation early on is a good way to organise the work and continued doing this for Assignment 3. We communicated quite well through messenger and google docs and were able to each do our parts of the assignment without there being much confusion. It was surprising how much of a challenge it was to figure out the details of the actual application. When we thought about what the application would actually consist of, the hole got deeper and deeper and we realised it was going to be quite a big task to actually make this application in the future. Working in a group can either be great or a nightmare. Luckily, all of our group members work hard and are willing to help others out if they need it. Overall, we worked quite well and are ready for the presentation.<br/><br/>




										<h4>Daffa</h4><br/>
High praise for great communication has to be given again, it has been so vital to the success of the group. A group chat was created during the creation of Tune Squad for Assignment 2 and every single time a member needed help with something. Someone always reached out and gave a helping hand, by either switching roles, taking on roles, giving advices and direction on where the project is headed towards. Although we have already stated from Assignment 2 that the group should work on time management. It looks like we haven’t improved since we will still be handing the work in on the last day, although it wasn’t rushed. It could’ve been done sooner with greater time management for ease of mind. One thing that was surprising was the amount of work there actually was to do. At first glance, the amount of work in the section Skills and Jobs seems to be easy and small, but that wasn’t the case. One thing I learnt about my group is everyone seems to be understanding of real life situations, if someone is in a predicament like needing to do another assignment other than IT, the group seems to be very patient and understanding. Like the previous assignment, only a few people are doing GitHub commits since it will get messy if too many people are playing with the site at once, hence the need to assign only a few people to work on the site whilst the others are doing their respective tasks.<br/><br/>



										<h4>Se Won</h4><br/>
After the completion of assignment 3 our group had worked very well together. This was through the high level of communication between each other. Each and every member worked well on the tasks they were assigned and didn’t complain about anything. Although we did complete the assignment on time, an improvement we could make as a group is our time management. We had left this assignment fairly late until the last few days, but this didn’t affect the quality of the work produced. Every member of the group had finished their parts of the assignment and was willing to do more if there were any parts undone by others or parts where people needed assistance. A thing I learnt through this assignment is working in a group is great as people can rely on others when needed and everything can be shared evenly.<br/><br/>
