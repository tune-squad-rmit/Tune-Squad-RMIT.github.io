										<p><h5>Daffa</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://yodaffa.github.io/<br/><br/>
My name is Daffa Buckley, my student number is s37146875. I was born in Indonesia, but then came to Australia when I was 7. I love sport and religiously keep in touch with AFL, NBA and Soccer. I am bilingual and can speak Indonesian and English, I am also currently trying to be trilingual, learning French. In my spare time I like to watch animes/netflix series or play games, preferably FIFA but I do play a whole lot of other games. Whilst I do not have  any IT skills, I have been consuming IT for most of my life. <br/><br/>

<h5>Daniel</h5><br/>

My name is Daniel Gao, and I am 18 years old. My student number is s3786266 and email is s3786266@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is Australian, but my parents originated from different parts of China. At home, I speak a mix of Chinese and English with my parents and my older sister. My IT interest began during high school.During year 11, I learnt a range of skills such as designing a website and creating my own simple game. Some of my hobbies include playing futsal and gaming on the weekend. <br/><br/>



<h5>Wyatt</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://wyattjenkins.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Wyatt Lawrence Jenkins.  My student number is s3770872. I have 2 email addresses, the first being my personal email address; wyattjen22@hotmail.com. The other is my student email address; s3770872@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Hamilton, New Zealand and lived there for the first 10 (nearly 11) years of my life. I moved to Australia due to my father’s work at the time and continued with primary school here in Australia at Langwarrin Park Primary School. After finishing primary school, I continued my education at Bayside Christian College. Since finishing school, I got a job in a racing stable as a stablehand.  In my free time, I enjoy watching films and shows on Netflix or otherwise, gaming and watching racing. I have just started my first semester at RMIT University and have taken a particular interest in the security field. My ideal job, at the present moment, would be as a penetration tester.<br/><br/>

<h5>Solomon</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://solomonclaringbull.github.io/<br/><br/>
Student Number: s3663489
Email: solomonclaringbull3@gmail.com
Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible. I have been using technology since I was very young, so I have sufficient knowledge of the Window’s and Apple’s infrastructure, however I don’t have any professional experience in IT. Technology has always mesmerized me, with the way that it has transformed our everyday life, so I decided to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology, here at RMIT.<br/><br/>

<h5>Josiah</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5> https://josiahwebster.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Josiah David Jambora Webster and my student number is s3785546. I am half-Australian and half-Filipino but I only speak English. I was originally born in Perth and moved to Melbourne when I was 9. My student email is 3785546@student.rmit.edu.au. My hobbies are practising the instruments I learn and playing games. My interest in IT is in understanding what goes on behind the scenes of what users ultimately see. My experience with IT is fairly limited apart from the fact that I’ve used technology throughout my life since a young age (computers, phones etc).<br/><br/>

<h5>Se Won</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://sewony65.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Sewon Yoon. My student number is s3782868. I have 2 email addresses, the first being my personal email address: sewony65@gmail.com. The other is my student email address s378286@student.rmit.edu.au. My interests in IT are how programs are run through an interface and how the program made has so many functions to use and how easily it is showed to the users. These interests in IT began when I used bought my laptop and used my phone a lot I realised how easy it was to use it, but didn’t really understand how it was possible to run these functions. I attended an event called a Hackathon without having any background knowledge about the event or IT. I walked in blindsided and saw the work the IT people in other groups were doing and was amazed that the codes they were typing ended up turning into a website or an app. This drove me to want to do IT. I don’t have any experience related to IT and want to learn many things throughout this course.

<h2 class="major"></h2>
<h3 class="major">Team Profile</h3>

From examining the outcomes of each of our test results, we have a discovered that no group member has the same personality type, and whilst we all have similarities (eg. most members tend to feel instead of think, and are more extraverted than introverted), our personality traits are mostly completely different. This variation of personalities is highly beneficial within a group,  especially as we are all on the same page, as it means that we will constantly be discussing and applying different ideas and approaches to our project as each member has a varied view and opinion. Considering this, our project will in turn have an inherently unique flair.

<h2 class="major"></h2>					
<h3 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h3>
										

 Daffa’s ideal job (Game Developer) is considered to be the most unique of the group’s, as it is an extremely creative and code orientated position, whilst the majority of the group (Josiah, Wyatt, Solomon and Sewon) are all looking to pursue a career in different fields of Security, and Daniel wishes to be a CTO; all roles which will not be nearly as creative as Daffa’s position. The roles of Sewon (Cyber Security), Solomon (Security Analyst) and Josiah (Security Manager) would all be fairly similar, as they focus on analysing and solving security threats, although Josiah’s position is more significant than Sewon and Solomon’s, as he would be a manager of the security sector within a firm, as well as an analyst. Wyatt’s job (Penetration Testing), whilst being similar to the other members looking to work in security, is significantly different, as instead of solving security threats, Wyatt is required to hack into a company’s security system and discover problems and deficiencies within it. Josiah and Daniel’s positions are both managerial, but we consider Daniel’s ideal job to be the most prestigious of the group’s, as a CTO is an executive-level position, and therefore is extremely hard to obtain whilst being incredibly important and well-paid. From analysing and comparing our group’s ideal positions, we discovered that the majority of our group have similar career plans, as Solomon, Sewon, Josiah and Wyatt all wish to work within security, whilst Daniel and Daffa’s career ideals vary from each other and the rest of the group; Daniel wishes to have an executive level position, and Daffa wants to work within the field of game development, the more creative side of IT .

After viewing the data, have our opinions on our ideal career changed?
Solomon
After examining the Burning Glass data, and comparing it to what my ideal job is, I still strongly lean towards a career in Security, but I have started considering a career in a Java related area, as experience in Java is seen as extremely valuable. I feel that if I improve my knowledge of Java, I should be able to successfully obtain a position (such as a programmer) once I finish my degree.
Daffa
From looking at the Burning Glass data, I discovered that my ideal job, or even job's similar, aren't listed in any of the top selections. However, this still didn't change what I consider my ideal career, and instead has just motivated me to pursue a career in games with more vigor, as it clearly is a harder position to attain than most IT positions.
Daniel
The position of CTO is an executive-level position, so the can only be 1 CTO of a company, theregore I am not surprised to find that it is not listed in any of the PDFs. Many of the general skills listed in the pdf were not listed as requirements for my job but considering how CTO is such a high level position, I can assume that I would be expected to have most of these skills already. The position of CTO is an extremely well-paying job, and because of this the data did not shift my opinion, even though I know that it will be a very hard position to obtain.
Wyatt
Every single one of my required general skills are listed in the PDFs, and I know that most general skills are transferable between jobs. However, most of my required IT skills are not listed in the PDFs. I know that this is because penetration testing is a very niche job, and whilst it is not a highly sought after position, as there are not many job openings for it, it is still a highly valued position and most people, even if they work in IT, would not have the required skills to fit the role. Because of this, examining the Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion and I am still set on a career in security.
Se Won
After viewing the Burning Glass data and examining it, I have decided that I want to move away from a position in Cyber Security and start learning to use SQL, so I can begin working towards positions that require the use of SQL, such as a Database Administrator, because SQL is the most sought after IT skill therefore meaning that many IT jobs require the use of SQL, so if I am skilled in it I should be able to successfully secure a job once I have finished my degree.
Josiah
Considering my current knowledge of IT, which I would not call extensive, viewing the Burning Glass data has made me aware of how many different IT skills there are, and what I assumed would be more sought after (Security related IT skills) actually aren’t even listed. I am now considering pursuing a career as a System Engineer, because according to the data, it is one of the more sought-after positions.
