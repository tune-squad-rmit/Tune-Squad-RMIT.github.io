In my spare time I like to watch animes/netflix series or play games, preferably FIFA but I do play a whole lot of other games. Whilst I do not have  any IT skills, I have been consuming IT for most of my life. <br/><br/>

In my free time, I enjoy watching films and shows on Netflix or otherwise, gaming and watching racing.

Student Number: s3663489
Email: solomonclaringbull3@gmail.com
Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible. I have been using technology since I was very young, so I have sufficient knowledge of the Window’s and Apple’s infrastructure, however I don’t have any professional experience in IT. Technology has always mesmerized me, with the way that it has transformed our everyday life, so I decided to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology, here at RMIT.<br/><br/>

Josiah:<br/><br/>
Website - https://josiahwebster.github.io/<br/><br/>

I was originally born in Perth and moved to Melbourne when I was 9. My student email is 3785546@student.rmit.edu.au. My hobbies are practising the instruments I learn and playing games. My interest in IT is in understanding what goes on behind the scenes of what users ultimately see. My experience with IT is fairly limited apart from the fact that I’ve used technology throughout my life since a young age (computers, phones etc).<br/><br/>

Se Won:<br/><br/>
Website - https://sewony65.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Sewon Yoon. My student number is s3782868. I have 2 email addresses, the first being my personal email address: sewony65@gmail.com. The other is my student email address s378286@student.rmit.edu.au. My interests in IT are how programs are run through an interface and how the program made has so many functions to use and how easily it is showed to the users. These interests in IT began when I used bought my laptop and used my phone a lot I realised how easy it was to use it, but didn’t really understand how it was possible to run these functions. I attended an event called a Hackathon without having any background knowledge about the event or IT. I walked in blindsided and saw the work the IT people in other groups were doing and was amazed that the codes they were typing ended up turning into a website or an app. This drove me to want to do IT. I don’t have any experience related to IT and want to learn many things throughout this course.</p>
