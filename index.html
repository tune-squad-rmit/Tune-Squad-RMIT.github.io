										<p><h5>Daffa</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://yodaffa.github.io/<br/><br/>
My name is Daffa Buckley, my student number is s37146875. I was born in Indonesia, but then came to Australia when I was 7. I love sport and religiously keep in touch with AFL, NBA and Soccer. I am bilingual and can speak Indonesian and English, I am also currently trying to be trilingual, learning French. In my spare time I like to watch animes/netflix series or play games, preferably FIFA but I do play a whole lot of other games. Whilst I do not have  any IT skills, I have been consuming IT for most of my life. <br/><br/>

<h5>Daniel</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://danielgao214.github.io/<br/><br/>
My name is Daniel Gao, and I am 18 years old. My student number is s3786266 and email is s3786266@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is Australian, but my parents originated from different parts of China. At home, I speak a mix of Chinese and English with my parents and my older sister. My IT interest began during high school.During year 11, I learnt a range of skills such as designing a website and creating my own simple game. Some of my hobbies include playing futsal and gaming on the weekend. <br/><br/>



<h5>Wyatt</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://wyattjenkins.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Wyatt Lawrence Jenkins.  My student number is s3770872. I have 2 email addresses, the first being my personal email address; wyattjen22@hotmail.com. The other is my student email address; s3770872@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Hamilton, New Zealand and lived there for the first 10 (nearly 11) years of my life. I moved to Australia due to my father’s work at the time and continued with primary school here in Australia at Langwarrin Park Primary School. After finishing primary school, I continued my education at Bayside Christian College. Since finishing school, I got a job in a racing stable as a stablehand.  In my free time, I enjoy watching films and shows on Netflix or otherwise, gaming and watching racing. I have just started my first semester at RMIT University and have taken a particular interest in the security field. My ideal job, at the present moment, would be as a penetration tester.<br/><br/>

<h5>Solomon</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://solomonclaringbull.github.io/<br/><br/>
Student Number: s3663489
Email: solomonclaringbull3@gmail.com
Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible. I have been using technology since I was very young, so I have sufficient knowledge of the Window’s and Apple’s infrastructure, however I don’t have any professional experience in IT. Technology has always mesmerized me, with the way that it has transformed our everyday life, so I decided to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology, here at RMIT.<br/><br/>

<h5>Josiah</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5> https://josiahwebster.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Josiah David Jambora Webster and my student number is s3785546. I am half-Australian and half-Filipino but I only speak English. I was originally born in Perth and moved to Melbourne when I was 9. My student email is 3785546@student.rmit.edu.au. My hobbies are practising the instruments I learn and playing games. My interest in IT is in understanding what goes on behind the scenes of what users ultimately see. My experience with IT is fairly limited apart from the fact that I’ve used technology throughout my life since a young age (computers, phones etc).<br/><br/>

<h5>Se Won</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://sewony65.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Sewon Yoon. My student number is s3782868. I have 2 email addresses, the first being my personal email address: sewony65@gmail.com. The other is my student email address s378286@student.rmit.edu.au. My interests in IT are how programs are run through an interface and how the program made has so many functions to use and how easily it is showed to the users. These interests in IT began when I used bought my laptop and used my phone a lot I realised how easy it was to use it, but didn’t really understand how it was possible to run these functions. I attended an event called a Hackathon without having any background knowledge about the event or IT. I walked in blindsided and saw the work the IT people in other groups were doing and was amazed that the codes they were typing ended up turning into a website or an app. This drove me to want to do IT. I don’t have any experience related to IT and want to learn many things throughout this course.

<h3 class="major">Team Profile</h3>

From examining the outcomes of each of our test results, we have a discovered that no group member has the same personality type, and whilst we all have similarities (eg. most members tend to feel instead of think, and are more extraverted than introverted), our personality traits are mostly completely different. This variation of personalities is highly beneficial within a group,  especially as we are all on the same page, as it means that we will constantly be discussing and applying different ideas and approaches to our project as each member has a varied view and opinion. Considering this, our project will in turn have an inherently unique flair.

<h2 class="major"></h2>					
<h3 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h3>
										

 Daffa’s ideal job (Game Developer) is considered to be the most unique of the group’s, as it is an extremely creative and code orientated position, whilst the majority of the group (Josiah, Wyatt, Solomon and Sewon) are all looking to pursue a career in different fields of Security, and Daniel wishes to be a CTO; all roles which will not be nearly as creative as Daffa’s position. The roles of Sewon (Cyber Security), Solomon (Security Analyst) and Josiah (Security Manager) would all be fairly similar, as they focus on analysing and solving security threats, although Josiah’s position is more significant than Sewon and Solomon’s, as he would be a manager of the security sector within a firm, as well as an analyst. Wyatt’s job (Penetration Testing), whilst being similar to the other members looking to work in security, is significantly different, as instead of solving security threats, Wyatt is required to hack into a company’s security system and discover problems and deficiencies within it. Josiah and Daniel’s positions are both managerial, but we consider Daniel’s ideal job to be the most prestigious of the group’s, as a CTO is an executive-level position, and therefore is extremely hard to obtain whilst being incredibly important and well-paid. From analysing and comparing our group’s ideal positions, we discovered that the majority of our group have similar career plans, as Solomon, Sewon, Josiah and Wyatt all wish to work within security, whilst Daniel and Daffa’s career ideals vary from each other and the rest of the group; Daniel wishes to have an executive level position, and Daffa wants to work within the field of game development, the more creative side of IT .

										<h3>After viewing the data, have our opinions on our ideal career changed?</h3>
<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Solomon</h4><br/><br/>
After examining the Burning Glass data, and comparing it to what my ideal job is, I still strongly lean towards a career in Security, but I have started considering a career in a Java related area, as experience in Java is seen as extremely valuable. I feel that if I improve my knowledge of Java, I should be able to successfully obtain a position (such as a programmer) once I finish my degree.<br/><br/>
<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Daffa</h4><br/><br/>
From looking at the Burning Glass data, I discovered that my ideal job, or even similar jobs, aren't listed in any of the top selections. However, this still didn't change what I consider my ideal career, and instead has just motivated me to pursue a career in games with more vigor, as it clearly is a harder position to attain than most IT positions.<br/><br/>
<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Daniel</h4><br/><br/>
The position of CTO is an executive-level position, so the can only be 1 CTO of a company, theregore I am not surprised to find that it is not listed in any of the PDFs. Many of the general skills listed in the pdf were not listed as requirements for my job but considering how CTO is such a high level position, I can assume that I would be expected to have most of these skills already. The position of CTO is an extremely well-paying job, and because of this the data did not shift my opinion, even though I know that it will be a very hard position to obtain.<br/><br/>
<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Wyatt</h4><br/><br/>
Every single one of my required general skills are listed in the PDFs, and I know that most general skills are transferable between jobs. However, most of my required IT skills are not listed in the PDFs. I know that this is because penetration testing is a very niche job, and whilst it is not a highly sought after position, as there are not many job openings for it, it is still a highly valued position and most people, even if they work in IT, would not have the required skills to fit the role. Because of this, examining the Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion and I am still set on a career in security.<br/><br/>
<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Se Won</h4><br/><br/>
After viewing the Burning Glass data and examining it, I have decided that I want to move away from a position in Cyber Security and start learning to use SQL, so I can begin working towards positions that require the use of SQL, such as a Database Administrator, because SQL is the most sought after IT skill therefore meaning that many IT jobs require the use of SQL, so if I am skilled in it I should be able to successfully secure a job once I have finished my degree.<br/><br/>
<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Josiah</h4><br/><br/>
Considering my current knowledge of IT, which I would not call extensive, viewing the Burning Glass data has made me aware of how many different IT skills there are, and what I assumed would be more sought after (Security related IT skills) actually aren’t even listed. I am now considering pursuing a career as a System Engineer, because according to the data, it is one of the more sought-after positions.<br/><br/>

										<h3>IT PROFESSIONAL: System Engineer</h3><br/><br/>


										<h5>Background knowledge:</h5><br/>
 Verint is a world renown company in the vast and dynamic technology industry, that specialise in the areas of customer engagement and cyber intelligence.<br/><br/>

										<h5>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h5><br/>
A system engineer at Verint is responsible for going out to client sites and helping them install the company’s software into their system and further configuring it to ensure the software is running smoothly. In addition, they are required to support their clients in the future if any errors arise or a new feature for the software needs to be installed. <br/><br/>
										<h5>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h5><br/>
The majority of clients for a system engineer are investors. These investors consist of people from different hierarchy ranks amongst different companies.<br/><br/>
										<h5>Project manager:</h5><br/>
They are required to install workforce management software for the project managers in order to help them manage their company’s schedule as well as educate them how to efficiently operate the software and troubleshoot any small issues.<br/><br/>

										<h5>Chief technology officer:</h5><br/>

They are invited to a corporate sale pitch where they have to display a presentation to sell the “Verint” software to other companies and showcase the strong aspects of the software and how it greatly improve your company’s management systems and security.<br/><br/>

										<h5>Other system engineers from other companies:</h5><br/>
They are required to interact with other system engineers within other companies in order to teach them how to troubleshoot the “Verint” software if any serious problems occur in the future.  <br/><br/>

										<h5>Database administrator:</h5><br/>
After the installation of the “Verint” software, they have teach to the administrator how manage and keep their data secure as the software requires further configuration from their own company. <br/><br/>

										<h5>Business users:</h5><br/>
After the installation of the workforce management software, they need to train users of the business how to efficiently run the program. <br/><br/>

										<h5>Call recording companies:</h5><br/>
They are required to install the “Verint” call recording software and teach them how to correctly manage the system.<br/><br/>



										<h5>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h5><br/>
A system engineer mainly spends most of their time at client sites, helping them install and configure the “Verint” software as well as educating the users of the software how to effective operate the system. Other times if any minor error occurs,  they can work from home or at the office by having remote access of the software through the company’s servers as everything can be monitored digitally. <br/><br/>
										<h5>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h5><br/>
The most challenging part of been a system engineer at Verint is learning a new product or feature for the software in a short period of time. For instance, a new feature for the software came out today and you are required to go the client’s site the next day to install and train the users at the company with limited knowledge when you are expected to have full understanding of the new installment. In addition, they are still maintaining and assisting other company’s softwares while learning new information of upcoming software updates or new technological products.

									<p><h3>Cybersecurity</h3><br/><br/>
 
<h5>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h5><br/><br/>
 
There are a vast number of jobs in computer science and IT, from web development and software engineering to database administration and hardware engineering - no matter where your expertise lies, you are bound to be useful in some way to the tech world. Amongst the plethora of roles in CS/IT, Cybersecurity is a field that seems to be growing at an extremely fast rate in comparison to the other fields. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that a 37% increase in the number of jobs in cybersecurity is expected for the period of 2012 to 2022. With new technology comes more efficient information processing. This means that cyber attacks are going to become more threatening as time goes on and as such; more experts in cybersecurity will be required to protect information. <br/><br/>
 
Information is one of if not our most valuable resource, and the field of cybersecurity is what safeguards information. Even though we typically only hear about security breaches in large organisations (like Sony or Ashley Madison, for example), the truth is that no-one is completely safe. There is no such system that is 100% immune from an attack. While many systems may be 'computationally infeasible' to breach, it is certainly not impossible and because of this, there is an ever-present risk to important information that, if in the wrong hands, could be devastating.<br/><br/>
 
Cryptography makes up a large part of cybersecurity. One example of an encryption algorithm in the public domain that is used today is the RSA encryption algorithm. This algorithm was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman in 1977 and is the most used cryptography algorithm used across the world.<br/><br/>
 
The genius of this algorithm is grounded in 2 aspects. The first is that it uses 2 different keys, a public key (used to encrypt plaintext to get ciphertext) and a private key (used to decrypt the ciphertext to get the plaintext again). The public key is known to everyone, but the private key is known only to the receiver of the data/message. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt data, but only the holder of the private key can unravel the message. This means that the public key can be sent between parties without the plaintext message being exposed while the private key needn't go any anywhere.<br/><br/>
 
The second aspect is that the algorithm uses prime numbers to make it too difficult, even for a computer, to find the private key (and therefore gain access to the secret data). Both the public key and private key uses two prime numbers (p and q). An element of the public key, n, is the product of p and q, however, p and q themselves are secret and are the 'heart', so to speak, of the RSA algorithm. If p and q are known, then an attacker can use these to calculate the private key. However, if they are not known, then an attacker can use the public key (n) to  find p and q. Or can they? If p and q were not prime numbers, then there are perhaps several values that would work for p and q to get n. But since an attacker only knows n, they have to factorise n so as to get p and q that are both prime. This means that p and q can only ever have 1 possible value respectively. In an attempt to brute force p and q, the computer must do many, many calculations. If p and q are small numbers it doesn't take long, but in the real world very large numbers are used and it would take a computer far too long to find p and q which means that data encrypted by RSA is considered 'safe'.<br/><br/>
 
Quantum computing is a technological advancement that is yet to reach us but is being worked on by computer scientists. It is perhaps not so close to being available, however, once the technology arrives it may prove to be problematic for modern cryptography. Rather than being based on a typical electronic system, quantum computers will be based on quantum physics. This basically means that a small unit like a bit, instead of being equal to 0 OR 1 (like in typical computers), can exist in what is called a superposition and can simultaneously be both 0 AND 1. These kinds of bits are known as qubits.<br/><br/>

<h5>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h5><br/><br/>
 
Quantum computers technically do currently exist, but on such a small scale that they are not useful yet. IBM currently has a quantum computer that has a mere 16 qubits. To put that in perspective, typical computers can have multiple gigabytes of random access memory (RAM). This is equal to billions of regular bits. Algorithms in modern cryptography, like RSA, are considered virtually uncrackable by the computational power currently available. This is due to the use of prime factorisation briefly described above. Keys that contain a product of p and q that are hundreds of decimal digits long take so long to crack that it is pointless to try. With quantum computing, a number this large could be cracked in a matter of hours using Shor's algorithm, however quantum computers are still quite some way from being able to calculate large numbers.<br/><br/>
 
In the future, stronger encryption systems will need to be devised as quantum computing will be able to break modern encryptions in a very short amount of time. The worry is that this kind of technological development will render all communication insecure as if everything was sent in plaintext. This would affect every communications system in the world and would be devastating. It is important that plans are made for replacement algorithm(s) as they could take a long time to implement. The NIST is already testing what is called 'post-quantum cryptography' which currently involves 69 new methods that could replace modern cryptography when quantum computing becomes the norm.<br/><br/>

Quantum computing will revolutionise the way data is processed. It will mean that certain encryption methods that I rely on to hide my communications will be rendered useless and that may mean that any messages I transmit will exist in plain sight with everyone having access. In an ideal future, replacement algorithms will be developed, tested and released ready for the public domain before quantum computing becomes mainstream.<br/><br/>
 
It’s not all bad news, though.This development could also change my life for the better. Because quantum computers will be able to analyse huge sets of data in a short amount of time, they can aid in the development of life-saving medicines that I (or my family) may need one day and solve very complex problems in science. Quantum computing will also be capable of making more informed weather forecasting, meaning I can make plans around weather forecasts more confidently. Traffic control will also become more streamlined due to this advancement. It would reduce congestion by routing traffic more efficiently and make my commute easier. Air traffic would follow suit, making the dreaded flying experience less taxing on myself whenever I do need to travel.<br/><br/>

									<h3>Machine Learning</h3><br/><br/>
<h5>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h5><br/><br/>
 
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is the study of algorithms in mathematics and computer science with the purpose of carrying out tasks based on conditions, rather than pre-defined instructions. Machine learning is essentially about showing a computer how to make predictions when given data. Machine learning is all about getting a computer to make sense of the messy real world. It is responsible for tasks such as separating relevant emails from spam, detecting obstacles in a self-driving vehicle as to avoid them or generating subtitles/captions for videos by analysing speech.<br/><br/>
 
A state of the art example of machine learning is the AlphaGo project, created by Google's DeepMind. AlphaGo is a computer program that was developed to play Go, a complex Chinese board game (like chess), as a sort of test to see how well DeepMind's neural network algorithm could navigate a complex game like Go against not just human players, but some of the world's best. The AlphaGo project began in 2014 and operates using an algorithm that is based on machine learning techniques and 'tree search' that has been sharpened through training with other computers as well as human players. To begin, AlphaGo was given a large amount of data that consisted of moves from past Go matches between human players. The database consisted of around 30 million moves. This allowed it to mimic human play immediately. Once the AI had improved enough, AlphaGo was made to play against versions of itself and from this, it learned even more about how to play Go optimally.<br/><br/>
 
In October 2015, AlphaGo beat a professional Go player for the first time ever, Fan Hui. Just months later, AlphaGo played 5 games against one of the top ranked players in the world, Lee Sedol. AlphaGo won 4 out of the 5 games they played. This was huge for the world of AI and machine learning as AlphaGo wasn't initially designed to be proficient at Go, but rather was designed to learn and was given the task of learning Go. Being the best at a board game doesn't sound like much of an achievement, but it was more of a test for the learning capabilities built into the algorithms designed by DeepMind. This means that an AI like AlphaGo can likely learn other, more practical skills that can help us in more profound ways.<br/><br/>
 
There is a fear that development in machine learning and AI can give rise to a kind of general intelligence. This may be more than just a few years away, but it has been said that we are closer than many of us realise. Sam Harris, a neuroscientist, author and philosopher, outlines this in a succinct way by make the point that we are already on a continuum towards building a kind of general intelligence in our machines. He states that if super-intelligent AI is impossible, then something must be wrong with one of the three following assumptions.<br/><br/>
 
Intelligence can simply arise in a physical system that is capable of information processing. As long as we continue to build better systems of atoms, we will eventually build one capable of general intelligence. Our brains have managed to do this and although complex, it is not beyond understanding.<br/><br/>
  
The second is that we will keep developing better and better systems, improving on this previous version. As long as the human species exists, we will keep improving our systems. Nothing short of extinction could stop us.<br/><br/>
  
The last assumption is that we, as humans, do not represent the peak of intelligence. If we were to build a self-learning AI that were as smart as we were, the idea is that it could improve upon itself and exceed us in ways we cannot imagine. Electronic circuits process information at speeds ridiculously faster than biological ones, so a general AI capable of self-learning would exceed us immediately.<br/><br/>
  
<h5>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h5><br/><br/>
 
Machine learning can give rise to an intelligence that would make machines superior to humans at just about any task. In terms of labour reduction, a super-intelligent AI capable of learning at an incredible rate would be revolutionary in its impact. People would be out of work due to not being able to keep up with machines. A general intelligence in a machine would have far too many advantages. One advantage includes the cost. A large lump sum for the technology itself would make for a costly investment, but a worthwhile one. This initial cost would be eclipsed over time as a machine does not require a wage like a human does. The costs involved would only include the initial sum, energy to power the machine and any repair costs. This kind of advantage already makes intelligent machines an attractive candidate for replacing employees, and yet there are many more advantages. Fair work would no longer be a concern - a machine cannot be injured or overworked (assuming proper maintenance of the machine, like cooling, oil, etc.). It does not require time off work, it does not need to be trained further than the initial machine learning process. Even so, the machine would learn the task at hand much faster than a human and beyond that, the same algorithm could then be applied to the rest machines in the same network. Machines are more reliable than humans - they are not late, they are not influenced by emotions or thoughts that are not relevant to the task at hand. Machines are capable of being precise right down to the smallest of units; a single millimetre, pixel, bit, particle, etc.<br/><br/>
 
This would have a huge impact on everyone around the world. Due to the number of jobs being taken by machines, people would have no income to support themselves. The owners of the companies who built these machines (likely to a tech giant such as Google, Facebook, Tencent, etc.) would have the lion's share of the wealth in the world while the rest would starve. It has been suggested then that a universal basic income would be required, otherwise the wealth inequality would leave the majority of the world to perish.<br/><br/>
 
The presence of this level of AI would remove any need for any human labour. It would also remove the need for any human intellectual work. With this kind of intelligence available, it would solve problems that humans have been trying to solve for centuries. A cure for cancer, a solution to climate change, financial models being created in ways that we could never conceive on our own. To create an AI capable of general intelligence is to do so much more that just that - it provides an answer to many of the world's problems.<br/><br/>

It's not exactly clear how this technology would impact my life without seeing it become a reality, first. There are fears that the development of a super-intelligent AI could cause immediate destruction to the human race. With an understanding of how powerful any one person or any one organisation could become with access to super-intelligence, concerns about who will be the first to develop a general AI aren't misplaced. This technology could be weaponised if it were to get in the wrong hands. To have access to this technology is to be thousands of years ahead of today's technological landscape. Privacy and data protection would evaporate with encryptions and hashes being brute forced at insanely fast speeds. Weapons capable of ending civilisation. Even just mere rumour of someone being close to developing a general AI could cause the human race to go crazy. If it were discovered that Google were on the brink of breaking through, how would powerful forces like China or Russia respond? Because having access to this kind of intelligence means to have access to unimaginable power, the likes of ethics, laws and rights would not be of much importance in the wake of this technology.<br/><br/>
 
Right now, it's hard to know if the AI development itself would even have a chance of a long-term impact on my life. Perhaps the global meltdown due to its emergence would  It would depend on what is being done in advance to prepare for this kind of technology, which doesn't seem to be as far away as many people think. <br/><br/>
