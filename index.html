Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible. I have been using technology since I was very young, so I have sufficient knowledge of the Window’s and Apple’s infrastructure, however I don’t have any professional experience in IT. Technology has always mesmerized me, with the way that it has transformed our everyday life, so I decided to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology, here at RMIT.<br/><br/>

<h5>Josiah</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5> https://josiahwebster.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Josiah David Jambora Webster and my student number is s3785546. I am half-Australian and half-Filipino but I only speak English. I was originally born in Perth and moved to Melbourne when I was 9. My student email is 3785546@student.rmit.edu.au. My hobbies are practising the instruments I learn and playing games. My interest in IT is in understanding what goes on behind the scenes of what users ultimately see. My experience with IT is fairly limited apart from the fact that I’ve used technology throughout my life since a young age (computers, phones etc).<br/><br/>

<h5>Se Won</h5><br/>
<h5>Website:</h5>https://sewony65.github.io/<br/><br/>
My full name is Sewon Yoon. My student number is s3782868. I have 2 email addresses, the first being my personal email address: sewony65@gmail.com. The other is my student email address s378286@student.rmit.edu.au. My interests in IT are how programs are run through an interface and how the program made has so many functions to use and how easily it is showed to the users. These interests in IT began when I used bought my laptop and used my phone a lot I realised how easy it was to use it, but didn’t really understand how it was possible to run these functions. I attended an event called a Hackathon without having any background knowledge about the event or IT. I walked in blindsided and saw the work the IT people in other groups were doing and was amazed that the codes they were typing ended up turning into a website or an app. This drove me to want to do IT. I don’t have any experience related to IT and want to learn many things throughout this course.

<h2 class="major"></h2>
<h3 class="major">Team Profile</h3>

From examining the outcomes of each of our test results, we have a discovered that no group member has the same personality type, and whilst we all have similarities (eg. most members tend to feel instead of think, and are more extraverted than introverted), our personality traits are mostly completely different. This variation of personalities is highly beneficial within a group,  especially as we are all on the same page, as it means that we will constantly be discussing and applying different ideas and approaches to our project as each member has a varied view and opinion. Considering this, our project will in turn have an inherently unique flair.

<h2 class="major"></h2>					
<h3 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h3>
										

 Daffa’s ideal job (Game Developer) is considered to be the most unique of the group’s, as it is an extremely creative and code orientated position, whilst the majority of the group (Josiah, Wyatt, Solomon and Sewon) are all looking to pursue a career in different fields of Security, and Daniel wishes to be a CTO; all roles which will not be nearly as creative as Daffa’s position. The roles of Sewon (Cyber Security), Solomon (Security Analyst) and Josiah (Security Manager) would all be fairly similar, as they focus on analysing and solving security threats, although Josiah’s position is more significant than Sewon and Solomon’s, as he would be a manager of the security sector within a firm, as well as an analyst. Wyatt’s job (Penetration Testing), whilst being similar to the other members looking to work in security, is significantly different, as instead of solving security threats, Wyatt is required to hack into a company’s security system and discover problems and deficiencies within it. Josiah and Daniel’s positions are both managerial, but we consider Daniel’s ideal job to be the most prestigious of the group’s, as a CTO is an executive-level position, and therefore is extremely hard to obtain whilst being incredibly important and well-paid. From analysing and comparing our group’s ideal positions, we discovered that the majority of our group have similar career plans, as Solomon, Sewon, Josiah and Wyatt all wish to work within security, whilst Daniel and Daffa’s career ideals vary from each other and the rest of the group; Daniel wishes to have an executive level position, and Daffa wants to work within the field of game development, the more creative side of IT .

										<h2 class="major">Group Reflection</h2>
										
										
										<h4>Solomon</h4><br/>
After completing the assignment, I personally thought that as a group we communicated extremely well, and every member completed their delegated tasks, so the work load was split fairly. However, our time management could be improved, as we only completed the final version of the assignment on the due date. I was very surprised to discover that Sewon no longer wanted to work in security, as before the assignment security was a passion of his. This assignment taught me that working within a group can be an incredibly joyous experience.<br/><br/>

										<h4>Josiah</h4><br/>
I feel that we demonstrated excellent communication as a group within our time working together and the tasks required were all completed by the due date. An improvement that could have been made was the speed in which we got to doing our actual work. It was left till the final days before the majority of the set work was completed by our group. A surprise was the effectiveness of the work once we did get into it, despite it being late.<br/><br/>

What I have learnt about working in groups is that it is not always a bad thing, and some groups can be a pleasant experience with each member doing their own parts, ultimately creating the wonderful final product. I expected a much less satisfying experience and will  not be as pessimistic towards the idea of group work in experience.<br/><br/>

										<h4>Daniel</h4><br/>
During the past few weeks of this assignment period, our group has work well and interacted positively with each other. Our group has showcased a list of strong traits for example good energy and effective communication between team members as well as delivering high quality work. However, some areas such as our group’s time management needed further improvement as we left sections of the assignment to the last few days before submission, but it did not heavily impact the group effort to produce excellent work. One thing that surprised me was the willingness to help each other from different members of the group as everyone was always happy to share a leading hand in completing and polishing the assignment. One thing that I learned about working in a group is teamwork and time allocation is key because without these two aspects, group work can be very confusing and frustrating between group members.<br/><br/>




										<h4>Wyatt</h4><br/>
Overall, the group worked well. From the get go, we established multiple means of communication and work-sharing through messenger, google docs and Github. This allowed us to stay in perpetual conversation to discuss anything assignment-related. What could have been improved is the proactivity of the group. I think it took too long for us to organise the work load and due to that, we lost a lot of time that could have been devoted to the assignment. One thing that was surprising was how streamlined the work was in a group of 6. There was very little confusion or miscommunication throughout the assignment work which was surprising as a group of 6 could lead to a lot of faults, as can be imagined. <br/><br/>

One thing I have learned about working in groups is how important it is to organise assignment into sections and divide them among group members. This way, everyone has a goal and therefore can begin work earlier. It also prevents the overlap of work and because of that, people won't waste their time completing tasks that others have already completed. The commit log on Github is not a completely accurate representation of the group's work. Tools was set to be completed by just 1 or 2 members while the rest of the group members were assigned other tasks. Our main decision behind this was to avoid chaos as too many members making changes can lead to a catastrophe.<br/><br/>


										<h4>Daffa</h4><br/>
Upon completion of the assignment, I think our communication were very organised, everyone knew what they were doing at certain points of the project. Everyone was able to be on the same page if someone needed to do something, majority jumped at the work that was given at hand. Although our group worked fairly well, the one thing we can improve significantly on is our time management. The reason is because we will be handing the assignment in on the last day of the due date. Although it doesn’t cause any harm to our grades, it also doesn’t hurt to do it earlier in case something happens like the internet doesn’t work or family emergencies. What I found most surprising was a lot of the people in the group were willing to spare time for others who needed help, although it wasn’t their part of the project, people were willing to sacrifice their time for another person. I personally would’ve expected the majority if not all to be a bit more selfish in a group environment by having less task and less work. I learnt that everyone believes the concept of this mobile application is great and if made into an actual app, it can be very successful making it globally recognised. They believe this because the app will be the only one of its kind adding social interaction, exercising and basketball together. When further adding the fact that we have taken the concepts of successful application that works and combining them together to make Basketball Tinder, they are all sure it could be huge if the application is made. The GitHub commit logs was not a very accurate representation of the group’s work on the assignment. This is because only a few members were supposed to work on it at a time, because when everyone tries to edit the website together, things got messy as we all don’t have the same brain and it became very unproductive. The solution was only a maximum of 2 members worked on it at a time whilst the other members did other parts of the assignment. It might have been catastrophic when doing the Tools section of the assignment due to the website design we chose; it wasn’t suitable to be worked on with a large number of people at a time.<br/><br/>



										<h4>Se Won</h4><br/>
Our Intro to IT group worked very well together. We had good chemistry as a whole as we didn’t get into any arguments, fights or have any miscommunication. There isn’t much room for improvement within the group but if there was something it would be that we rarely met up to work together, but we all completed the individual task required. What surprised me was how efficient our group worked together and prioritised this assignment to get it done to the best of our abilities. I’ve learnt that with the people in this group we can be friends outside of group work too. I strongly believe that this mobile application will be successful if further development was made into making the application.<br/><br/>
