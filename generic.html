<h2>After viewing the data, have our opinions on our ideal career changed?<h/2>
	<h2 class="major"></h2>	
										<h4>Solomon</h4>
<p>After examining the Burning Glass data, and comparing it to what my ideal job is, I still strongly lean towards a career in Security, but I have started considering a career in a Java related area, as experience in Java is seen as extremely valuable. I feel that if I improve my knowledge of Java, I should be able to successfully obtain a position (such as a programmer) once I finish my degree.</p><br/><br/>
	<h2 class="major"></h2>	
	<h5>Daffa</h5>
<p>From looking at the Burning Glass data, I discovered that my ideal job, or even similar jobs, aren't listed in any of the top selections. However, this still didn't change what I consider my ideal career, and instead has just motivated me to pursue a career in games with more vigor, as it clearly is a harder position to attain than most IT positions.</p><br/><br/>
	<h2 class="major"></h2>	
	<h6>Daniel</h6>
<p>The position of CTO is an executive-level position, so the can only be 1 CTO of a company, theregore I am not surprised to find that it is not listed in any of the PDFs. Many of the general skills listed in the pdf were not listed as requirements for my job but considering how CTO is such a high level position, I can assume that I would be expected to have most of these skills already. The position of CTO is an extremely well-paying job, and because of this the data did not shift my opinion, even though I know that it will be a very hard position to obtain.</p><br/><br/>
	<h2 class="major"></h2>	
	<h7>Wyatt</h7>
	
<p>Every single one of my required general skills are listed in the PDFs, and I know that most general skills are transferable between jobs. However, most of my required IT skills are not listed in the PDFs. I know that this is because penetration testing is a very niche job, and whilst it is not a highly sought after position, as there are not many job openings for it, it is still a highly valued position and most people, even if they work in IT, would not have the required skills to fit the role. Because of this, examining the Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion and I am still set on a career in security.</p><br/><br/>
	<h2 class="major"></h2>	
	<h8>Sewon</h8>
<p>After viewing the Burning Glass data and examining it, I have decided that I want to move away from a position in Cyber Security and start learning to use SQL, so I can begin working towards positions that require the use of SQL, such as a Database Administrator, because SQL is the most sought after IT skill therefore meaning that many IT jobs require the use of SQL, so if I am skilled in it I should be able to successfully secure a job once I have finished my degree.</p><br/><br/>
	<h2 class="major"></h2>	
	<h9>Josiah</h9>
<p>Considering my current knowledge of IT, which I would not call extensive, viewing the Burning Glass data has made me aware of how many different IT skills there are, and what I assumed would be more sought after (Security related IT skills) actually aren’t even listed. I am now considering pursuing a career as a System Engineer, because according to the data, it is one of the more sought-after positions.
